1.3.23:

    we will need to begin the code as well as start studying the rest of the book. 

    I already have a repo with some stuff on matrices (https://github.com/iai9/matrices), so that will be a valuable asset.
    we will have to expand upon this in order to represent what we have learned from the book

    as of right now:

        will need to represent a vector
        Make an object or smth to represent Groups
        Can expand on above to represent vector space 
        (unsure of how to represent this, will think more later)
        Determine if vector space valid
        Determine if subspace valid
        Find if set of vectors if linearly independent
        Find if set of vectors spans v space
        Find if set of vectors is basis of v space (see above)
        Determine rank of a matrix (should be easy with above)
        implement mappings (just a function)
        determine if mapping is linearl

        create a transition matrix given two basis (ez)
        represent a mapping as a transformation matrix
        Formula to change basis of transformation matrix

    we probably wont be able to implement all of this, but we will see.
    we also will have to forge ahead in the book, so this stuff is questionable
