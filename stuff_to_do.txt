1.3.23:

    we will need to begin the code as well as start studying the rest of the book. 

    I already have a repo with some stuff on matrices (https://github.com/iai9/matrices), so that will be a valuable asset.
    we will have to expand upon this in order to represent what we have learned from the book

    as of right now:

        will need to represent a vector
        Make an object or smth to represent Groups
        Can expand on above to represent vector space 
        (unsure of how to represent the )
